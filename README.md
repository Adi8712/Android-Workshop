# ICC World Cup
#### _The Last Cricket App you'll use, Ever_

This project was built during the [Android Workshop](https://gdsc.community.dev/e/mjqg5q/). The aim of the project is simple:
- Provide the details of ICC WORLD Cup 
- Use modern UI.

## Tech

The project uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) - Dependency Injection library for Android built on top of the popular DI library, [Dagger](https://dagger.dev/)
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - Turns the HTTP API into interfaces
- [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Allows data to persist UI changes thereby eliminating the need to fetch data again
- [Glide](https://bumptech.github.io/glide/) - An image loading library that helps to fetch, decode, and display video stills, images, and animated GIFs
- [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html) - Helps to enable asynchronous programming for android
- [Lottie](https://airbnb.design/lottie/) - An animation library that allows the usage of predefined animations or customise them as necessary

And of course the project itself is open source with a [public repository](https://github.com/Adi8712/Android-Workshop) on GitHub.

## UI

This project focuses on using a minimalist design centered around the official ICC World Cup theme
